My name is Daniela and I'm going to talk about repeaters. Now to start I have to say that connection through cables is the best one in terms of speed, but it is not always possible to take them to every corner of the house due to distance issues or to how expensive it is, that's the reason why the repeaters appeared. To add a little more context I can't mention a particular year or person that created the repeaters because they are actually a modern version of a concept that already existed and it was applied to telegraphy, but what I can say is that they were intended to improve the wifi signal and they were designed to function as a bridge between those areas where there is a good signal and those where the coverage is not good. So if you're thinking about getting a repeater to your house, or if tou are wondering how this device carried the wifi signal from one point to another, this is what you have to know: every repeater works with two routers, the first one picked up the wifi signal, and transferred it to the second one, and this second router transfers the signal boosted, to get it to have more scope and reach more rooms of the house. So, through this procedure, what the repeater does is not to create a new signal, but to amplify the existing wifi signal and spread it wirelessly to more corners of the house.
On the other hand if you already installed a repeater in your house and it didn't work, it may be because it is bad located, and you have to make sure that it is in a place where there is a good signal, so it can then replicate it.
