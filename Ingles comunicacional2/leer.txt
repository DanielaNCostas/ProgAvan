La conexión a través de cables es la mejor en cuanto a velocidad, pero como no siempre es posible llevarlos a todos los rincones de la casa por cuestiones de distancia, surgen estos dispositivos. 

Los repetidores son dispositivos que sirven para mejorar la señal de wifi y lograr que llegue a más rincones de cierto lugar.

Los repetidores funcionan como puente entre la zona donde hay cobertura y la zona donde no llega.

Un repetidor tiene dos enrutadores inalambricos: el primero recoge la señal wifi existente y la transfiere al segundo para transmitirla de nuevo potenciada para que tenga mayor alcance

My name is Daniela and I'm going to talk about repeaters. 
The connection through cables is the best in terms of speed, but since it is not always possible to take them to every corner of the house due to distance issues, this devices appeared. 

I can´t talk about the invention of the repeater, because it is actually a modern version of a concept that already existed and was applied to telegraphy, so I can´t mention a particular year or creator, but I can say that these devices were intended to function as a bridge between areas where there is a good signal, and those where coverage does not reach.

The repeaters were designed to improve the Wi-Fi signal and make it reach more sectors of a certain place.

If you are using a repeater in your house, and you're wondering how the device carried the signal from one point to another, I will try to describe what it did: each repeater works with two routers, the first one picked up the existing Wi-Fi signal and through antennas transferred it to the second one to transmit it boosted and get it to have more scope. Through this procedure, the repeater amplified the signal and spread it wirelessly to more corners of the house. On the other hand, if you bought a repeater 

On the other hand, if you installed a repeater in your house and it did not work, it may be that it was located in the wrong place. It is useless to place it in a place where there is a bad signal, you have to make sure that it is in a place where a good signal arrives so that it can replicate it.
